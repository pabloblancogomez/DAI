abstract = {The Colour Pattern Regression (CPR) algorithm complement for QGIS is presented for determining and quantifying the relationship between aerial images and raster maps. Aerial images can be readily decomposed into their standard RGB spaces that assign numerical values to their colours. According to them, a linear regression can be established to correlate raster values with the colour patterns, and if the model performance is considered satisfactory, the result will provide a raster interpolation with finest resolution according to colour nuances within the aerial image. The CPR Algorithm allow both, the calculation of the regression coefficient and the evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model. The use of the present QGIS complement could enable the study of the relationships of aerial images and earth surface products – e.g. soil moisture content, landcover, vegetation and forests, soils, urban heat islands – or marine products – e.g. chlorophyll, total suspended solids. The tool is open source and will be readily adapted with additional features and improved general performance ratings thresholds for the physical problems to be solved.}

ABSTRACT = {In the last years the need to numerically define color by its coordinates in n-dimensional space has increased strongly. Colorimetric calibration is fundamental in food processing and other biological disciplines to quantitatively compare samples’ color during workflow with many devices. Several software programmes are available to perform standardized colorimetric procedures, but they are often too imprecise for scientific purposes. In this study, we applied the Thin-Plate Spline interpolation algorithm to calibrate colours in sRGB space (the corresponding Matlab code is reported in the Appendix). This was compared with other two approaches. The first is based on a commercial calibration system (ProfileMaker) and the second on a Partial Least Square analysis. Moreover, to explore device variability and resolution two different cameras were adopted and for each sensor, three consecutive pictures were acquired under four different light conditions. According to our results, the Thin-Plate Spline approach reported a very high efficiency of calibration allowing the possibility to create a revolution in the in-field applicative context of colour quantification not only in food sciences, but also in other biological disciplines. These results are of great importance for scientific color evaluation when lighting conditions are not controlled. Moreover, it allows the use of low cost instruments while still returning scientifically sound quantitative data.},

abstract = {The Earth surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiation shows conspicuously an anisotropic behavior just like the bi-directional reflectance of visible and near infrared spectral domains. The importance of thermal radiation directionality (TRD) is being more and more widely recognized in the applications because of the magnitude of the effects generated. The effects of TRD were originally evidenced through experiments in 1962, showing that two sensors simultaneously measuring temperature of the same scene may get significantly different values when the viewing geometry is different. Such effect limits inter-comparison of measurement datasets and land surface temperature (LST) products acquired at different view angles, while raising the question of measurement reliability when used to characterize land surface processes. These early experiments fostered the development of modeling approaches to quantify TRD with the aim of developing a correction for Earth surface TIR radiation. Initiatives for pushing the analysis of TIR data through modeling have been lasted since 1970s. They were initially aimed at mimicking the observed TIR radiance with consideration of canopy structure, component emissivities and temperatures, and Earth surface energy exchange processes. Presently, observing the Earth surface TRD effect is still a challenging task because the TIR status changes rapidly. Firstly, a brief theoretical background and the basic radiative transfer equation are presented. Then, this paper reviews the historical development and current status of observing TRD in the laboratory, in-situ, from airborne and space-borne platforms. Accordingly, the TRD model development, including radiative transfer models, geometric models, hybrid models, 3D models, and parametric models are reviewed for surfaces of water, ice and sea, snow, barren lands, vegetation and urban landscapes, respectively. Next, we introduce three potential applications, including normalizing the LST products, estimating the hemispheric upward longwave radiation using multi-angular TIR observations and separating surface component temperatures. Finally, we give hints and directions for future research work. The last section summarizes the study and stresses three main conclusions.}

abstract = {Sentinel-3 is a newly launched satellite implemented by the European Space Agency (ESA) for global observation. The Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensor onboard Sentinel-3 provides 21 band images with a fine spectral resolution and is of great value for ocean, land and atmospheric monitoring. The two platforms (Sentinel-3A and -3B) can provide OLCI images at an almost daily temporal resolution. The coarse spatial resolution of the 21 band OLCI images (i.e., 300 m), however, limits greatly their utility for local, precise monitoring. Sentinel-2, another satellite provided by ESA, carries the Multispectral Imager (MSI) sensor which can supply much finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10 m and 20 m) images. This paper introduces a new fusion framework integrating spatio-temporal-spectral information for downscaling Sentinel-3 OLCI images, which has two parts. Based on bands with similar wavelengths (i.e., bands 2, 3, 4 and 8a for Sentinel-2 and bands Oa4, Oa6, Oa8 and Oa17 for Sentinel-3), the four Sentinel-3 bands are first downscaled to the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images by applying spatio-temporal fusion to Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI images. Then, to take full advantage of all 21 available OLCI bands of the Sentinel-3 images, the extended image pair-based spatio-spectral fusion (EIPSSF) method is proposed in this paper to downscale the other 17 bands. EIPSSF is performed based on the new concept of the extended image pair (EIP) and by exploiting existing spatio-temporal fusion approaches. The framework consisting of spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral fusion is entirely general, which provides a practical solution for comprehensive downscaling of Sentinel-3 OLCI images for fine spatial, temporal and spectral resolution monitoring.}

ABSTRACT = {Tropical forests regulate the global water and carbon cycles and also host most of the world&rsquo;s biodiversity. Despite their importance, they are hard to survey due to their location, extent, and particularly, their cloud coverage. Clouds hinder the spatial and radiometric correction of satellite imagery and also diminishing the useful area on each image, making it difficult to monitor land change. For this reason, our purpose is to identify the cloud detection algorithm best suited for the Amazon rainforest on Sentinel&ndash;2 images. To achieve this, we tested four cloud detection algorithms on Sentinel&ndash;2 images spread in five areas of the Amazonia. Using more than eight thousand validation points, we compared four cloud detection methods: Fmask 4, MAJA, Sen2Cor, and s2cloudless. Our results point out that FMask 4 has the best overall accuracy on images of the Amazon region (90%), followed by Sen2Cor&rsquo;s (79%), MAJA (69%), and S2cloudless (52%). We note the choice of method depends on the intended use. Since MAJA reduces the number of false positives by design, users that aim to improve the producer&rsquo;s accuracy should consider its use.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor was launched 28 October 2011 on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. VIIRS has 22 spectral bands covering the spectrum between 0.412 µm and 12.01 µm, including 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands) with a nominal spatial resolution of 750 m at nadir, five imaging resolution bands (I-bands) with a nominal spatial resolution of 375 m at nadir, and a day-night band (DNB) with a near-constant nominal 750 m spatial resolution throughout the scan. These bands are located in a visible and near-infrared focal plane assembly (FPA), a shortwave and midwave infrared FPA, and a long-wave infrared FPA. All bands, except the DNB, are coregistered for proper environmental data records retrievals. Observations from VIIRS instrument provide long-term measurements of biogeophysical variables for climate research and polar satellite data stream for the operational community's use in weather forecasting and disaster relief and other applications. Well Earth-located (geolocated) instrument data are important to retrieving accurate biogeophysical variables. This paper describes prelaunch pointing and alignment measurements, and the two sets of on-orbit correction of geolocation errors, the first of which corrected error from 1300 m to within 75 m (20\% I-band pixel size) and the second of which fine-tuned scan-angle dependent errors, bringing VIIRS geolocation products to high maturity in one and a half years of the SNPP VIIRS on-orbit operations. Prelaunch calibration and the on-orbit characterization of sensor spatial impulse responses and band-to-band coregistration are also described.},

ABSTRACT = {The study of banana herbs and fruits is rarely conducted using multidisciplinary approaches. However, a multidisciplinary approach could be useful for gaining information on many aspects, including remote sensing, biodiversity and biogeography, owing to the uniqueness of bananas. The present article reviews a study on banana herbs from an Indonesian perspective. It starts by obtaining information related to firmness, peel&rsquo;s colour change, water content and sugar content corresponding to Brix and Starch values. It then proceeds to find the relation between remote sensing (RS) technologies of all these biophysical characteristics and genomics, transcriptomic and metabolomics. Besides this, geospatial sciences, such as geographic information systems (GIS), may help visualise biogeographical factors that help analyse a land&rsquo;s suitability for growing bananas. Furthermore, the plant canopy, health and plant disease, and the herbs&rsquo; water content, analysed through satellite images and aerial photos of drones, helps describe the banana distribution in Indonesia, at both the local and regional levels. Similar techniques may be applied to explore and analyse the characteristics of the fruit. In the end, the integration of these methods can foster advanced studies on bananas, even making it possible for its scope to extend to industries, food technology, post-harvest, and eco-tourism.},
